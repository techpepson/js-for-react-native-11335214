# Program Description

- Task 1
  In Task 1, I have a function called processArray, and in this function, I am basically mapping through an array of numbers using the map() method of javascript which takes in a callback which I have named num.
  I am conditionally return a doubled value when the division of num by 2 gives an even number and tripling the same value when the division is odd. After that

- Task 2
  In task 2, I have a function called formatArrayString with two parameters, numArray and strArray. What this function does is, when the number obtained from processArray() is an even number, the strArray is capitalized using the toUpperCase() method and when the number is not an even number, the strArray is all turned to lowercases using the toLowerCase() method in Javascript. It is relevant to note that the formatArrayString() depends on the processArray() function.

- Task 3
  In this task, I have a function called crateUserProfiles which takes in two parameters, originalName and modifiedName. What happens with this function is, I loop through the originalName parameter and whenever I loop through each of them, I push the elements in this array into an empty array I call arrayObject as an object. I also push along the index of these elements which start from 1 and auto-increment. After that, initialize the function defined here and console.log the result.
